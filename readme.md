LESS build system package for Sublime Text 2
======================================

Provides two build systems for `.less` files, both minified and non-minified. Requires lessc (via node.js) on OSX and Linux.

Installing
----------
**With the Package Control plugin:** The easiest way to install this package is through Package Control, which can be found at this site: [http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control)

Once you install Package Control, restart ST2 and bring up the Command Palette (Command+Shift+p on OS X, Control+Shift+p on Linux/Windows). Select "Package Control: Install Package", wait while Package Control fetches the latest package list, then select `LESS` when the list appears.

**Without Git:** Download the latest source zip from [github](https://github.com/berfarah/LESS-sublime-build/zipball/master) and extract the files to your Sublime Text "Packages" directory, into a new directory named `LESS`.

**With Git:** Clone the repository in your Sublime Text "Packages" directory:

    git clone https://github.com/berfarah/LESS-build-sublime.git LESS

The "Packages" directory is located at:

* OS X:
    `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/`
* Linux:
    `~/.Sublime Text 2/Packages/`
* Windows:
    `%APPDATA%/Sublime Text 2/Packages/`

**Be aware:** On OSX you need lessc installed (via node.js / npm) and in your `PATH`.

Setting Up
----------
This package includes multiple build packages, each doing a different thing.  In order for updates to the package not to overwrite which one you wish to use, each build package has the extension sublime-build-choice, and the one you want to use is symlinked to LESS.sublime-build.

Go into your package directory (shown above), open the LESS-build directory, and run either changeLESSBuildType.bat (if you're on windows) or changeLESSBuildType.sh (if you're on OSX or Linux) to register which type you'd like to use.

There are currently two build choices; Normal and Directory Rewrite.

####Normal
Saves the css or min.css file in the same directory as the less file
An Example: building C:\someproject\less\components\buttons\border.less would put the css in C:\someproject\less\components\buttons\border.css


####Directory Rewrite
Saves the css or min.css file in the css directory, but with the same directory structure.
An example: building C:\someproject\less\components\buttons\border.less would put the css in C:\someproject\css\components\buttons\border.css
Note: The folder must be called less, and it will only go into css!
